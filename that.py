print """Zen/mantras of managing a coding project, by Lei Huang
 
0. Set timelines and industrialize the agenda
0.1 Keep track of progress: What did I accomplish today? Am I on track?

1. First think through data structure (representations)
1.1 Use built-in types as much as possible (list, tuple, dict)
1.2 Use existing libraries/packages as much as possible (OD, np.ndarray, np.matrix, pd.Series, pd.DataFrame)
1.3 Customize data structures only when really necessary
1.4 Composition vs. Inheritance...

2. First think through algorithms/computations linking data structures
2.1 Core: a few; most: mundane manipulations; rest: syntactic sugars

3. Start general in framework, but simple in details
3.1 Abstraction is powerful
3.2 But may come with performance cost especially with duplicate computations

4. Use marks such as FIXME (with importance levels such as ***) and never lose 
sight of destinations
4.1 Destinations have hierarchies
4.2 Rapidly prototype first and then profile before optimization: premature 
optimization is the root of much evil

5. Write tests based on basic data structures
